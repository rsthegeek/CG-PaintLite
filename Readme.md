## CG Project: A Simple Paint App With Processing
----
As part of my graphics bachelor's degree program, I undertook a project to create a simplified version of the Microsoft Paint application using (Processing)[http://processing.org/], an open-source programming language and environment. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge and skills in graphics programming to develop a functional application that demonstrated my proficiency in the subject matter.
